JMeter jPOS Sampler  
===================  
  
JMeter jPOS sampler plugin for stress test ISO8583 protocol.  
  
# Building JMeter Plugin  
  
`mvn dependency:copy-dependencies install -DexcludeGroupIds=org.apache.jmeter`  
  
Note: the '-DexcludeGroupIds=org.apache.jmeter' parameter tells maven not to copy the jmeter jars into the target dependencies directory. This is necessary if you run a different version of jmeter than what this plugin compiles against as when you copy over the JMeter-jPOS-components jars (see below) you will end up with different versions of the ApacheJMeter jar in jmeter's lib directory, which really confuses the app when it tries to run.   
  
# Copy the artifacts into the JMeter lib and lib/ext Directoryâ€™s.  
  
`cp -Rf  ~/JMeter-jPOS-components/target/jmeter-jpos-components-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar lib/ext/`  
  
`cp -Rf ~/JMeter-jPOS-components/target/dependency/* lib/`  
  
You are all set, You can start the JMeter UI  
  
# Note  
  

 - Packager field defines your iso packager in the program, usually using xml type. You can look iso87binary.xml at resource directory  
 - Copy the content of q2 log request to the text area, for example:  
  
	`<header>32434123</header>`  
	`<field id="0" value="0810"/>`  
	`<field id="42" value="300004000050046"/>`  
	`<field id="46" value="5F040B3030303030303030303031DF90080B3030303030303030303032" type="binary"/>`  
  
  DO NOT FORGET TO KEEP BREAK LINE per `< />` just as your q2.log. Or you can open the test-jmeter-jpos.jmx (included)
